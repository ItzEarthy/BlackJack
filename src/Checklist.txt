1. Initial Setup
   - Card Deck Structure:
     - Implement a 52-card deck with suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and values (2-10, J, Q, K, A).
     - Create function to shuffle the deck.
     - Develop logic for drawing a card from the deck.
   - Game Rules and Hand Value Calculation:
     - Write logic to calculate the value of a hand.
     - Implement handling of Aces (1 or 11 based on hand value).
   - Bankroll Management:
     - Set up bankroll initialization, allowing players to specify their starting tokens.
     - Add basic functionality for placing bets and adjusting bankroll based on outcomes.

2. Game Flow and Turn Logic
   - Player Actions:
     - Implement "Hit" action to draw an additional card.
     - Implement "Stand" action to keep the current hand.
     - Display options to "Hit" or "Stand" on each turn.
   - Dealer Actions:
     - Program dealer to hit until hand value is at least 17.
     - Implement dealer bust condition if hand goes over 21.
   - Game Outcome and Win/Loss Logic:
     - Compare player and dealer hands to determine winner.
     - Update player bankroll based on win, lose, or draw outcome.
     - Handle tie scenarios appropriately.

3. Text-Based Interface and Testing
   - Text-Based User Interface:
     - Display player's hand, hand total, and bankroll.
     - Display dealer's hand and hand total (only one card face-up initially).
     - Show options for "Hit" and "Stand" during playerâ€™s turn.
     - Display win/loss outcome at the end of each round.
   - Game Flow Polishing:
     - Refine game loop to ensure smooth transitions between turns.
     - Implement option to play another round or exit the game.
   - Testing and Debugging:
     - Conduct functional tests for all game logic (e.g., busts, blackjack, ties).
     - Test edge cases (e.g., dealer hits 17 with Ace, player gets Blackjack, bankroll edge cases).
     - Verify bankroll updates accurately after each hand.
     - Debug any issues with game logic or interface interactions.

4. Optional Stretch Goals
   - Graphical User Interface (GUI):
     - Set up a simple GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter, HTML/CSS for web).
     - Add buttons for "Hit" and "Stand" in GUI.
     - Display player and dealer hand totals in GUI.
     - Include elements for bankroll, bet amount, and outcome messages.
   - Card Images:
     - Add images for each card (based on suit and value).
     - Display player and dealer cards as images in GUI.
   - Advanced Betting & Payout Structure:
     - Implement a 3:2 payout for natural Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card).
     - Enable players to adjust their bet size between rounds.
     - Ensure bankroll updates correctly with advanced payouts.
